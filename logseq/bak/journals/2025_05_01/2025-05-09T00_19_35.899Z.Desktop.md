	- Today was a pretty good day.
	  
	  We had NJSLA Math Testing. It was two sections: 7 questions no calculator and 9 questions with a calculator. It went pretty good though.
	  
	  School was fairly good. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. We continued building our wheelee bot in Technology Applications. We also got our grades for the big science test. I got a 68/70(97%).
	  
	  When I came home I went on a slow 5K, nothing crazy about that.
	  
	  Allergies are still happening. But yeah, so far so good.
