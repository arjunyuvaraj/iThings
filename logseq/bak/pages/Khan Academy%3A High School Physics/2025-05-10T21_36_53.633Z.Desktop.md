- ## Unit 01: Motion and Forces
	- ### Describing motion
		- **Vector Quantity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- When a quantity has **direction and magnitude**
		- **Scalar Quantity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- When a quantity **only has magnitude**
		- **Position** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- **Position** means **location**
			- We must choose a reference points in order to describe where something is.
			- We must chose if right or left is positive or negative
			- **Position** is a **vector**
			- Noted in **meters**
		- **Velocity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- **Velocity** means how **quickly the position changes**
			- Velocity is the **change in position over the change in time**
			  $$v = \frac{\delta x}{\delta t}$$
			- **Velocity** is a **vector** quantity.
			- Noted is **Meters per Second**
		- **Speed** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- **Speed** is how **quickly the distance is traveled**
			- **Speed** is the **distance traveled over the time**
			  $$S=\frac{d}{t}$$
			- **Speed** is always **positive**
			- Speed is a **scalar** quantity
				- It **only** has a magnitude, not direction
			- **Noted in Meters per Second**
		- **Acceleration** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- How **quickly something speeds up**
			- **Acceleration** is the **the rate of change in velocity**
			- The **change in velocity over time**
			  $$A=\frac{\delta v}{\partial t}$$
			- Measured by **meters per second per second** meaning that **Acceleration is measured as meters per second squared**
			- Acceleration is a **vector quantity**
			- #### More Cases
				- **Speeding Up:** positive acceleration
				- **Slowing Down:** negative acceleration
				- **Constant Velocity:** acceleration is zero
				- **Curving Object:** Non-zero acceleration
	- ### Forces
		- **Force** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- **A force** is a **push or pull**
			- Measured in **newtons**(approximately the weight of the apple)
			- Force is a **Vector quantity**
			- We can write force like this:
			  $$\Sigma F=15N\longrightarrow{}$$
			  The arrow at the end shows the direction. Also note that there should be an arrow on top of the F
		- #### Different Types of Forces
		  collapsed:: true
			- $V_{a}$ - Applied Force
			- $V_{T}$ - Tension Force
			- $V_{g}$ - Gravitational Force
			- $V_{n}$ - Normal Force(perpendicular to the surface)
			- $V_{f}$ - Frictional Force
			- $V_{d}$ - Drag Force
			- $V_{th}$ - Thrust Force
			- $V_{b}$ - Buoyancy Force
			- $V_{l}$ - Lift Force
		- #### Free Body Diagram
			- We can use **Free-Body Diagram** to help us analyze the different forces acting on an object
			- Draw the object as a box and then draw arrows(preferably to scale) indicating the different forces
			- Add and subtract the forces to find the final amount of force acting on an object.
	- ### Newton's first and second laws
		- #### Newton's First Law
			- **An object at rest** has a **natural tendency to stay at rest** until **an unbalanced force acts on it**
			- **An object in motion** has a **natural tendency to stay in motion with the same velocity** until **an unbalanced force acts on it**
		- #### Newton's Second Law
			- **Acceleration is proportional to the net force**. However, **acceleration and mass are inversely proportional**:
			  $$A=\frac{v}{m}$$
			- Objects with more mass have more inertia
- ## Unit 02: Force Pairs and Momentum
	- ### Newton's Third Law
	  collapsed:: true
		- When you put a force on something, the same object puts a force back on you.
		- When $A$ puts a force on $B$, $B$ puts an **equal and opposite magnitude** force on $A$
		  $$F_{AB}=-F_{AB}$$
		- However, note that **the mass has an impact**
	- ### Momentum
		- **Momentum** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- Momentum is the **mass times the change in velocity**
			  $$m\cdot\partial V$$
				- Here's how we get to it:
					- $$\Sigma F=am$$
					  $$\Sigma F=m\cdot\frac{\partial V}{\mathrm{d}t}$$
					  $$\Sigma F=\frac{m\left(V_{i}-V_{f}\right)}{\partial t}$$
					  $$\Sigma F=\frac{mV_{i}-mVf}{\partial t}_{}$$
					  $$\Sigma F=\frac{\partial mv}{\partial t}$$
			- With momentum we can re-write the definition of net force:
			  $$\Sigma F=\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}$$
			- Momentum is a **vector quantity**
			- Momentum is **directly proportional** to the **mass and veloctiy**
	- ### Conservation of Momentum
		- When an cannon ball is shot forward the cannon itself moves backward
		- If $A$ **and** $B$ are **only interacting with each other:**
		  $${\partial P_{A}}=-{\partial P_{B}}$$
		- Whatever momentum A loses object B will gain it
	- ### Impulse
		- **Impluse** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
			- Revisiting Newton's second law:
			  $$\Sigma F=\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$$
			  $$\Sigma F\cdot\partial t=\partial p$$
			- $\Sigma F\cdot\partial t$ is **Impulse**
			- **Impulse** is the **change in velocity**
			- **Impulse** is measured in **Newtons per second**
