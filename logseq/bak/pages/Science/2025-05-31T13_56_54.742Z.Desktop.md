  Welcome to my hub for Science. This page includes EVERYTHING that is linked as science. All three sciences are included here: Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Under each category are the names of various courses and under THAT you can find different lessons. Hope this helps!
- # üçé Physics
  This is the section for everything physics related it primarily focuses on only notes taken in class an at home. However, I hope to include a variety of different articles and resources that may prove to be useful in the future!

  This section is, obviously, for everything big and small and related to life on Earth(maybe that will change). Similar to the other sections this is primarily notes taken during or after school with some notes from different courses. I hope to add a LOT of useful articles in the event I need them later on!

  This section is evidently for chemistry and all reactions that take place in this world. This section, like the other two, is a compilation of notes taken at various different times. While not all notes were taken in class, they, hopefully, will prove to be future later on
