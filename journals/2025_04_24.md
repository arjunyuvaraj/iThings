	- Today was a.... meh day.
	  
	  So school was pretty good. Nothing CRAZY happened. We got muchkins in leadership and pizza in baking. However, after school i very clearly told dad not do touch the pizza but he missheard me so I didn't get to eat it... 
	  
	  The BCA Placement test was today. Honestly, I think I did pretty good. I'm willing to say AMA I. Spanish was EASY. Props to Sr. Nunez and Sra. Dray. 
	  
	  Not much to highlight. Also, I'm tired. Let me go to bed.
