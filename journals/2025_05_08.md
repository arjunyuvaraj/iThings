	- Today was a really fun but tireing day!
	  
	  Since we won the mock trial we got to go and present it at the New Jersey Law Assosiation in Rutgers which was really fun. It was nerve-wrecking though. We also got to see another group, but i don't think they did as good as us(no bias). The bus ride back was really fun we were all talking and just having a good time.
	  
	  School was really chill though. We came bak half-walf through fifth period(Science), and I realized we got new seats. Mr. G told me where mine was and Leon gave me his notes to copy. Chef B was out which was pretty fun.
