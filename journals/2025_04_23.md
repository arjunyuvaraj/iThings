- ##  ‚úèÔ∏è Summary
  collapsed:: true
	- Today was a pretty good day!
	  
	  In school, we contained learning about circles, primarily focusing on the different parts like chords, diameters, and radius. We also had our quarter four reset meeting and Mr. Ferrara said we were improving. Though, that isn't a high standard. Unfortunately, Mr. Lockatell was out but I had orchestra that period. Since I'm going to be missing the spring concert for the BCA Induction ceremony, I told Ms. Lilikas but she hasn't responded yet. In science we continued to study for our test. It might get pushed to Tuesday, yay! The test is 70 questions: 35 MCQ, two points per question. In baking we got new groups, and my group isn't that bad. In Spanish we started reading *Ezperanza*
	  
	  As far as BCA goes, I attend the BCA Student Information Session. So far, the teachers and SPARK seem really supportive. Dr. Hank apparently likes Mac, and Mr. Respass likes Windows. They let you use your own IDE. 
	  
	  In Mega Six we practiced the first 10 in chapter 13 and I stumbled through the first 10 in 16.
