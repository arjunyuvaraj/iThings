- ##  ✏️ Summary
  collapsed:: true
	- Today was a really fun day!
	  
	  We went down to the Food Bank to do some volunteer work for advisory which was fun. Me, Leon, Dan, and Ishaan packed dry pasta into bags! In total got 200, EXACTLY. We went in rounds of five, and me being me, I wanted a round number.
	  
	  Besides that I am preparing for the spring concert it is tomorrow! We also had an NJHS meeting where we made cards for teachers. I helped Max make a card for Ms. Jackson! But, we couldn't find her, so we dropped it off in her mailbox.
