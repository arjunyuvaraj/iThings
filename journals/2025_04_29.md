	- Today was an average day.
	  
	  We had testing and I got the literary analysis one. We had to take two pieces of text, find the theme and compare them. It wasn't hard, just annoying.
	  
	  School was good beside that. Guidance got an email saying they received an email from BCA asking for the records. Now I need to submit the withdrawal forms.
