	- Today was a GREAT day!
	  
	  It is Adhithya's Birthday, so hopefully everything goes smoothly! Regardless, it's the morning that I write this... so, hopefully, I can finish it in the evening. It was actually really fun! I got some really aesthetic photos, and Sahasra posted it on her Pintrest for me. Also, we cut a three layer moose cake, with literally NO bread... it was really rich. We got to watch for forty minutes, and we slept at 11:00.
