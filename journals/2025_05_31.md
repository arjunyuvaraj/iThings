- ##  ✏️ Summary
	- Today was a AWSOME day!
	  
	  I got my new desk and chair, which are both great. They are both helping me improve my posture. Hopefully I can remember to stand enough! I decided to stop reading Contangion. It just wasn't a great book. We went on a ten mile run, and I was done by the end of it
