- ##  ‚úèÔ∏è Summary
	- Today was a fairly good day, I mean it's Friday(y el cuerpo lo sabe!)
	  
	  But on a more serious note today was a fairly good day! I got a decent amount of work done which was awesome! Adhithya hung out with Miguel and ate some ice cream(vanilla with a LOT of chocolate sprinkles). He also has semi-formal today. And, Mom and Dad are out shopping at Costco, which leaves me all alone. I'm currently typing this listening to some Lofi beats, all by myself. But hey, life is still pretty great! Also, Mom just called! So give me one second!
	  
	  Also, on the walk home I talked to SO MANY people. First, I was walking home with Chris, and then he left after a while for an orthodontist appointment. Then, I talked with Nirvaan and a few minutes later Arun called. So, all three of us talked. Then, on Rock Rd, Ayaansh called, something about the NJHS speech. Then, I saw Rishan and Jai, so we talked to them. Finally, I Arun called about something. This took us all the way to Marlboro Rd, at which point it was just me and Nirvaan.
