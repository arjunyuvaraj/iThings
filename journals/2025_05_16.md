- ##  ✏️ Summary
	- Today was a fairly good day, I mean it's Friday(y el cuerpo lo sabe!)
	  
	  But on a more serious note today was a fairly good day! I got a decent amount of work done which was awesome! Adhithya hung out with Miguel and ate some ice cream(vanilla with a LOT of chocolate sprinkles). He also has semi-formal today. And, Mom and Dad are out shopping at Costco, which leaves me all alone. I'm currently typing this listening to some Lofi beats, all by myself. But hey, life is still pretty great! Also, Mom just called! So give me one second!
