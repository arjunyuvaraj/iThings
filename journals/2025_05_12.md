	- Today was a good day.

	  NJSLA Science testing was today, and it was surprisingly easy. I expected it to be a lot more difficult if I'm being completely honest. Chef Barbieri was out today.
	  
	  Mom wants me to write the graduation speech. She says if I don't submit it on time, we'll go to the Lake House late. Truth be told, I really don't like asking dad for help. It's extremely annoying. He never admits his mistake, he says he does, but he doesn't understand apologies should be given in a certain timeframe. Unlike him, not all of us take hours to process who was right and wrong. He also doesn't understand that sometimes, an apology has to be given in order to move on. Whether you are right or wrong. When he threw a book at me, he waited forever to give his apology. Sometimes, it's disappointing to see that he makes these mistakes... or maybe its just my interpretation? Regardless, expand the bullet point if you really want to get angry... lol.
