	- Today was an interesting day!
	  
	  So today, we(Ayaansh, Aiden, and I) had the Math presentation on parallegorams. Ayaansh made the problems really difficult so practically no one could solve them. One girl(Sophia), literally gave up. It was really funny. Mrs. Buchar says we did pretty good though!
	  
	  I also had to speak at the NJHS Induction Ceremony today! I presented Service. Henry did Leadership, Ethan did Scholarship, Isabella did Character, and Maya did Citizenship. Mom said I did good though so that was great! There were also refreshments after and everyone was begging for cookies. I ate two cookies and one cupcake(I also saved one cookie for Adhithya). After that we stood outside while Mom was talking to Rishan/Opu's Mom. They also bumped into another BCA student which might tutor me!
