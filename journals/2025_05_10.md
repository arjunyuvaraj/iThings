	- Today was an interesting day
	  
	  As of the time of writing(20:48), I'm STILL stuffed from lunch. They day started out pretty good. Woke up around 8:00 at three waffles and stepped out around 10:00. Then, I came home at around 12:00 showered, and the whole family went out to eat at the Grand Lux Cafe. Food was AWSOME! We went there for Mother's Day. The only issue was that I was really stuffed. However, I ate way too much and the portions were HUGE. Mom and I went down to Loft to do some returns and the line was huge! However, there was some pretty fun treats: powdered doughnuts, cannoli, chocolate chip muffins, and a red velvet cupcake. Both mom and I took four each. By that point I was stuffed.....
	  
	  Besides that it was a pretty fun day! We played CRTOA and I worked on fixing Logseq and Github and added the new [[Science]] Hub!
