- ##  ✏️ Summary
  collapsed:: true
	- Today was a pretty fun day!
	  
	  The PPO picnic was today, which was really fun. Mom and Dad were being really annoying about the clubs, but I guess they are just they were just trying to help so I guess I can respect that. I saw Kavish and Jai but we were all hanging out with our friends from our towns. 
	  
	  Also, I am genuinely how Priya Aunty knows that the BCA picnic was today she know s literally EVERYTHING... it's kind of concerning.
