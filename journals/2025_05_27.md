- ##  ✏️ Summary
	- Today was an exsauthing day!
	  
	  Today is the first day in a WHILE, that I get to summarize my day! Woo hoo!
	  
	  So to summarize the WHOLE entire Lake House trip I will attach the album. However, it was still pretty fun. We went on a short hike in a beautiful trail and we learnt how to play poker, I also played pool. Link for photos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/VR7HxmPJqRMJT9sHA
	  
	  Rahul Uncle taught us how to play poker and I mae $2,200 which was awesome! We were making jokes how we are saving for the Casion, it's called our College Fund
