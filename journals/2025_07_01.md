	- Today was a.... its been a long time since I did this...
	  
	  I know I didn't write on the first day of summer camp... but I am enjoying it! Period One is discussions, which I love. Tanya Didi really knows how to get a good conversation going. Period Two we are doing devanagri games and for the first time I actually learnt something useful: "What is your name?" Period Three is with Uncle(everyone behaves better) and we are going over some slokhas from Chapter 16! Period Four is with Palavi Didi and Neer Bhaiya and we work on our project and skit. So far, we have made a bracelet/key chain with one character trait that we value. Also, our topic is conscience.
