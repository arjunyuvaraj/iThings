	- Today was an.... exshausting day.
	  
	  I went on a 13-mile run and it was difficult. I didn't exactly forget to bring a bar, but by the end I was absolutely HUNGRY. My stomach was making the weirdest sounds. We were both groaning by the end. But I made it through. The weather was NOT helpful, though there were some occassional winds it was still humid.
