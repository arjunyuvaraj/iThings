	- Description:
	- <b>From the author of <i>A Tangle of Knots</i> and <i>Absolutely Almost</i>, a touching story about a boy who won't let one tragic accident define him.</b>
	  Everyone says that middle school is awful, but Trent knows nothing could be worse than the year he had in fifth grade, when a freak accident on Cedar Lake left one kid dead, and Trent with a brain full of terrible thoughts he can't get rid of. Trentâ€™s pretty positive the entire disaster was his fault, so for him middle school feels like a fresh start, a chance to prove to everyone that he's not the horrible screw-up they seem to think he is.Â 
	  If only Trent could make that fresh start <i>happen.</i>
	  It isnâ€™t until Trent gets caught up in the whirlwind that is Fallon Littleâ€”the girl with the mysterious scar across her faceâ€”that things begin to change. Because fresh starts arenâ€™t always easy. Even in baseball, when a fly ball gets lost in the sun, you have to remember to shift your position to find it.
