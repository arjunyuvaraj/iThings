- ## Coulomb's Law
	- **Electromagnetic Forces** give way to several different types of forces: friction, thrust, and such
	- As **gravity comes from mass**, **electrostatic forces come from charge**
	- ### Inside the Atom
		- Proton - Postive Charge
		- Neutron - Neutral Charge
		- Electron - Negative Charge
		- Charge is measured in **coulombs**
		- If $e=1.602\cdot10^{-19}$ then $P=1e$, $N=0e$, $E=-1e$ where P, E, and N, are Protons, Neutrons and Electrons respectively
		- Most objects have the **about the same number of protons and electrons.** Therefore, they have no charge
	- Like charges repeal while opposite charges attract
	- Moreover, the more distance the weaker the force
	- Therefore we get:
	  $$F_e=\frac{Kq_1q_2}{r^2}_{}$$
		- The Coulombs constant($K$) is about $8.99\cdot10^9$
	- ### Electric fields
		- Everything creates and electric field
		- **Electric Fields** cause **Electric Forces**
		- Amount of force per charge:
		  $$E=\frac{Fe}{Q_2}_{}$$
		  (where $Q_2$ is a test charge)
