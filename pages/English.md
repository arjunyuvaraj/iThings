- #  ‚òïÔ∏è Welcome
  Welcome to my hub for English. This encompasses a WIDE variety of topics mainly covering Writing and Reading. However, it also includes allof my book reviews starting form the date of writing this! [[May 28th, 2025]]! Also, this may include notes from future classes!
- # üìñ Book Reviews
  The book review section is a compilation of EVERYTHING I have EVER read... since June of 2025. As of writing this it only has one book, but hopefully, as time progress I can add to the list. Each book review is split into four sections. To get the book review template type `/template`, after that click `Book Template`
