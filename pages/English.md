		- **Lost in the Sun** by Lisa Graff
			- {{renderer :full-house, template-book-card, title=Lost in the Sun, authors=Lisa Colleen Graff, publishedAt=12/31/2014, isbn=0399164065, categories=Juvenile Nonfiction / Social Topics / Dating & Relationships, Juvenile Fiction / Family / General, Juvenile Fiction / Family / Marriage & Divorce, Juvenile Fiction / Family / Siblings, Juvenile Fiction / Social Themes / Emotions & Feelings, Juvenile Fiction / Social Themes / Friendship, pages=289, language=en, publisher=Penguin, maturityRating=NOT_MATURE, description=<b>From the author of <i>A Tangle of Knots</i> and <i>Absolutely Almost</i>, a touching story about a boy who won't let one tragic accident define him.</b><br> <br> Everyone says that middle school is awful, but Trent knows nothing could be worse than the year he had in fifth grade, when a freak accident on Cedar Lake left one kid dead, and Trent with a brain full of terrible thoughts he can't get rid of. Trent's pretty positive the entire disaster was his fault, so for him middle school feels like a fresh start, a chance to prove to everyone that he's not the horrible screw-up they seem to think he is. <br> <br> If only Trent could make that fresh start <i>happen.<br></i> <br> It isn't until Trent gets caught up in the whirlwind that is Fallon Little--the girl with the mysterious scar across her face--that things begin to change. Because fresh starts aren't always easy. Even in baseball, when a fly ball gets lost in the sun, you have to remember to shift your position to find it.<br> <br> <b>Praise for <i>Lost in the Sun</i>:</b><br> <br> A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book of the Year!<br> <br> <b>*</b> "Graff writes with stunning insight [and] consistently demonstrates why character-driven novels can live from generation to generation."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> *STARRED*<br> <br> <b>*</b> "Graff creates layered, vulnerable characters that are worth getting to know."--<i>Booklist </i>*STARRED*<br> <br> <b>*</b> "[A]n ambitious and gracefully executed story."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> *STARRED*<br> <br> <b>*</b> "Weighty matters deftly handled with humor and grace will give this book wide appeal."--<i>School Library Journal</i> *STARRED*<br> <br> <b>*</b> "Characterization is thoughtful."--<i>BCCB</i> *STARRED*<br> <br> "In <i>Lost in the Sun</i>, Trent decides that he will speak the truth: that pain and anger and loss are not the final words, that goodness can find us after all--even when we hide from it. This is a novel that speaks powerfully, honestly, almost shockingly about our human pain and our human redemption. This book will change you."--Gary Schmidt, two-time Newbery Honor-winning author of <i>The Wednesday Wars </i>and <i>Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy</i><br> <br> "Lisa Graff crafts a compelling story about a boy touched with tragedy and the world of people he cares about. And like all the best stories, it ends at a new beginning."--Richard Peck, Newbery Award-winning author of <i>A Year Down Yonder</i> and <i>A Long Way From Chicago</i><br> <br> <br> <b>Lisa Graff's Awards and Reviews:</b><br> <br> Lisa Graff's books have been named to 30 state award lists, and <i>A Tangle of Knots </i>was long-listed for the National Book Award., thumbnail=http://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=PEmLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73BZsU3TNOC_7-vQnXIUBTyJ1_fV0RbOjg12rvzNjrKlVlP9IDIbBNxNBOiGU4Ft02IToqvAxgW9pxLM87woPPMmpi-Gmhf9hTUdhDX53zOzwQaPML3UsmWH0TrWqj06qGrcj_R&source=gbs_api }}
