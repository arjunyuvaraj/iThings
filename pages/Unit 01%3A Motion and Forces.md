- ## Describing motion
  collapsed:: true
	- **Vector Quantity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- When a quantity has **direction and magnitude**
	- **Scalar Quantity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- When a quantity **only has magnitude**
	- **Position** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Position** means **location**
		- We must choose a reference points in order to describe where something is.
		- We must chose if right or left is positive or negative
		- **Position** is a **vector**
		- Noted in **meters**
	- **Velocity** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Velocity** means how **quickly the position changes**
		- Velocity is the **change in position over the change in time**
		  $$v = \frac{\delta x}{\delta t}$$
		- **Velocity** is a **vector** quantity.
		- Noted is **Meters per Second**
	- **Speed** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Speed** is how **quickly the distance is traveled**
		- **Speed** is the **distance traveled over the time**ddd
		  $$S=\frac{d}{t}$$
		- **Speed** is always **positive**
		- Speed is a **scalar** quantity
		  collapsed:: true
			- It **only** has a magnitude, not direction
		- **Noted in Meters per Second**
	- **Acceleration** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- How **quickly something speeds up**
		- **Acceleration** is the **the rate of change in velocity**
		- The **change in velocity over time**
		  $$A=\frac{\delta v}{\partial t}$$
		- Measured by **meters per second per second** meaning that **Acceleration is measured as meters per second squared**
		- Acceleration is a **vector quantity**
		- #### More Cases
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Speeding Up:** positive acceleration
			- **Slowing Down:** negative acceleration
			- **Constant Velocity:** acceleration is zero
			- **Curving Object:** Non-zero acceleration
- ## Forces
  collapsed:: true
	- **Force** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- **A force** is a **push or pull**
		- Measured in **newtons**(approximately the weight of the apple)
		- Force is a **Vector quantity**
		- We can write force like this:
		  $$\Sigma F=15N\longrightarrow{}$$
		  The arrow at the end shows the direction. Also note that there should be an arrow on top of the F
	- #### Different Types of Forces
	  collapsed:: true
		- $V_{a}$ - Applied Force
		- $V_{T}$ - Tension Force
		- $V_{g}$ - Gravitational Force
		- $V_{n}$ - Normal Force(perpendicular to the surface)
		- $V_{f}$ - Frictional Force
		- $V_{d}$ - Drag Force
		- $V_{th}$ - Thrust Force
		- $V_{b}$ - Buoyancy Force
		- $V_{l}$ - Lift Force
	- #### Free Body Diagram
	  collapsed:: true
		- We can use **Free-Body Diagram** to help us analyze the different forces acting on an object
		- Draw the object as a box and then draw arrows(preferably to scale) indicating the different forces
		- Add and subtract the forces to find the final amount of force acting on an object.
- ## Newton's first and second laws
  collapsed:: true
	- ### Newton's First Law
	  collapsed:: true
		- **An object at rest** has a **natural tendency to stay at rest** until **an unbalanced force acts on it**
		- **An object in motion** has a **natural tendency to stay in motion with the same velocity** until **an unbalanced force acts on it**
	- ### Newton's Second Law
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Acceleration is proportional to the net force**. However, **acceleration and mass are inversely proportional**:
		  $$A=\frac{v}{m}$$
		- Objects with more mass have more inertia
