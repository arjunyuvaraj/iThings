- ## Kinetic and potential energy
	- **Energy** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Measured in **Joules**
		- **Scalar** quantity
		- #### Energy Due To...
			- Motion - Kinetic Energy
			- Location - Potential Energy
		- Energy is **always the same, the total energy never changes**
	- **Kinetic Energy** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Energy due to **movement**
		- Represented by $K$
		- Formula:
		  $$K=\frac12mv^2$$
	- **Potential Energy** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Potential Energy is dependent on **two objects**
		- System of **interacting particles**
		- Represented by $U$
		- Dependent on position
		- The potential energy at any distance can be calculated as:
		  $$K_1+K_2=\frac{kq_1q2}{r}_{}$$
		-
- ## Conservation of energy
	- **Conservation of Energy** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Energy is neither created nor destroyed
		- The total energy($P+U$) will **never change**
		-
- ## Work and Power
	- **Work** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Amount of Energy **transferred** by a force
		- Measured in **Joules**
		- **Scalar** quantity
		- **When the force is the SAME as the velocity to the object** that is **POSITIVE WORK**, the opposite is the **NEGATIVE**
		- If the force applied is **perpendicular** there is **ZERO** force
	- **Power**
		- Rate of doing work
		- Formula
		  $$P=\frac{Work}{time}$$
		- Measured in **Joules per Second**
