- ## Voltage and Current
	- **Voltage** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Similar to **Gravitational Potential**, voltage is like **Electric Potential**
		- Represented in **Joules per Coulomb**
		- Difference between the **electric potential difference**
		- Often times, voltage is represented between the difference of the ground
	- **Gravitational Potential** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- **Gravitational Potential**(no energy at the end)  is a number in space that represented the amount of **gravitational potential energy** an object can hold. Represented in J/kg
	- **Electric Current** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- Flow of net charge
		- Measured as Coulombs per second, or Amperes(also known as amps)
		- We need voltage to have electric current
		- **Insulators** keep the electrons tightly bound
		- **Conductors** let the electrons move
		- 0
