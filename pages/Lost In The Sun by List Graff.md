		- #### On Guilt and Responsibility #quote
		  "Miss Eveline said I shouldnâ€™t say that, that I killed Jared, because it was an accident, what happened, and that wasnâ€™t the same thing at all. But accident or not, Jared Richards died, and I was the reason, so what was the difference? Either way, I killed him" (Graff 17).
		- #### On Anger and Emotions #quote
		  "As soon as he said that, I got that fire in my body, the one that started like a ball in my chest, dense and heavy, then radiated down to my stomach, my legs, my toes, and out to my neck, my face, my ears. Even all the way to my fingernails. Hot, prickly, fire skin, all over" (Graff 11).
		- #### On Acceptance and Change #quote
		  "I'm not broken, I'm just different now" (Graff 168).
		- #### On Control and Perspective #quote
		  "If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it" (Graff 228).
		- #### PERSONAL FAVORITE: On Shifting Perspectives #quote

	- ###  **Section 3.1:** Rating
	  collapsed:: true
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  **Rating: 7.5/10**
		  #+END_NOTE
		  While the book was defiantly interesting, I do feel like the progression was slower than I liked. Moreover, it was as "action-packed" as some of the other good books that I have read in the past. Regardless, the book is still a good book and I would recommend it(see section 3.2).
	- ### **Section 3.2:** Would Recommend?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Personally, this book depends on who I am recommending the book to. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys sports. However, I would suggest that they have to have a high interest in reading, as the book can get dry in certain places.
	- ### **Section 3.3:** What stuck with you?
	  collapsed:: true
		- The book taught me the value of perspective and how by shifting the way we perceive things, we can come to different conclusions. Additionally, the book highlights the topic of emotions, with the protagonists own rage appearing in several different instances. I feel like it allowed me to empathize with the ways other people might express their own emotions.
