	- ### Main Themes:
		- Originally, Trent Zimmerman resents his father, and has little to no friends. However, throughout his years, he slowly comes to terms with the death of a peer, and slowly opens himself to other connections.
		- **THEME TOPICS:**
			- Guilt
			- Anger
			- Family
			- Friendship.
			- Trauma
		- **THEME:** A vast majority of events in life are unpredictable and when people let uncontrollable circumstances control their mindset they lose sight on what matter's most: family and friends
	- ### Setting
		- The book takes place in a small town in California. Trent has two parents that live in different towns; they are divorced.
	- ### Tone/Mood
		- The overall tone of the book is more laid back, however, at certain points it can get tense. After reading the book, I have a feeling he might have some anger issues or something of the sort.
	- ### Narrative Style
		- The book is written in first person. Hence, readers are given insight on his trauma and thoughts. On top of that, he expresses his anger as a fire.
	- ### Pacing
		- The book progresses relatively slow. It starts around the beginning of sixth grade. From my perspective I think it leads into May-ish, Spring, as that seems to be the time the play baseball.
