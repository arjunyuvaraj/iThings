- ## 01. Vectors
- ## 02. Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors
- ## 03. Linear transformations and matrices
	- Linear Transfomration
		- **Transformation** essentially means function: input and output
		- **Linear** has two properties
			- Lines can not be curved
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The Origin must NEVER move
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- For the most part it should keep gird lines parallel
		- The only thing you need to understand is when $\hat{\imath},\hat{\jmath}$ land, from there you can deduce an equation
		- The following equation is EXTREMLY useful... it allows us to find any new vector based on how $\hat{\imath},\hat{\jmath}$ in the new graph. By multiplying them on the old vector, you get the new one
		  $$
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  a & b \\
		  c & d
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  x \\
		  y
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  = 
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  ax + bx \\
		  cy + cy
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  $$
