- ## Newton's law of gravitation
	- **Gravity**
		- **Gravity** is the **force of attraction between two masses**
		- **Gravity** is **directly** related to **mass** while **distance** is **inversely** related to the **distance**
		- **Universal law of gravitation:**
		  $$F_{g}=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}_{}$$
		- $r$ is the distance between the **center of the two masses**
		- $G$ is approximately $6*6*10^{-11}$
		- #### Objects Close To Earth
			- Note that any when measuring any objects close to earth is essentially the radius of Earth: $6400$
			- By substituting things out(where $M$ is the mass of the earth and $R$ is the radius of the Earth):
			  $$F_{g}=\frac{GMm}{R^2}$$
		- Which holds true for all objects close to earth(where $g=\frac{GM}{R^2}$):
		  $$F_{g}=mg$$
		  $$F_{g}=9.81m$$
- ## Falling objects
  collapsed:: true
	- If you drop a bowling ball and a feather in a vaccum they will land at the same time
	- The mass and the inertia cancel out with each other. Hence, they fall at the same time
- ## Orbital motion
	- **Centripetal Force** #[[Physics Vocabulary]]
		- **When the force of an object is always directed to the center**
		- Caused by **friction**
	- ### Keplers 3 Laws
		- All planets revolve around the Sun in an elliptical motion with the Sun as one of the foci
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps across equal areas in equal time intervals
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Farther the planet, longer the time
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- logseq.order-list-type:: number
